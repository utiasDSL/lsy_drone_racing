    has changed from negative to positive. If so, the drone has crossed the plane spanned by the
    gate frame. We then check if the drone has passed the plane within the gate frame, i.e. the x
    and z box boundaries. First, we linearly interpolate to get the x and z coordinates of the
    intersection with the gate plane. Then we check if the intersection is within the gate box.
