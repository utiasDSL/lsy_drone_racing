"""This module implements an AttitudeController for quadrotor control.

It utilizes the collective thrust interface for drone control to compute control commands based on
current state observations and desired waypoints. The attitude control is handled by computing a
PID control law for position tracking, incorporating gravity compensation in thrust calculations.

The waypoints are generated using cubic spline interpolation from a set of predefined waypoints.
Note that the trajectory uses pre-defined waypoints instead of dynamically generating a good path.
